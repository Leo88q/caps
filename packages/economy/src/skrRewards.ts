// GUTTERCAPS economy — SKR (Seeker) as the second REWARD currency
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Owner decision (Phase 6 Q1): SKR is not only a payment rail but also a
// reward currency. Constraint that shapes everything here: the SKR mint
// authority is Solana Mobile's Squads vault, so the game can NEITHER mint
// SKR (no emission schedule) NOR burn it (no sink). Therefore:
//
//   * SKR rewards come from a treasury-funded PRIZE POOL (`SkrPool`,
//     programs/staking/src/instructions/skr.rs). Nothing is promised that
//     has not been deposited first — `vault ≥ budget + reserved` on-chain.
//   * The pool is fed by a fixed share of the SKR the game actually EARNS
//     (packs paid in SKR, SKR listings' fees, services paid in SKR). Real
//     revenue in → a bounded share out. No revenue → no SKR rewards, and the
//     $CG emission keeps the game liquid. The pool can never inflate anything.
//   * Distribution reuses the Merkle-root machinery with dedicated root kinds
//     5..7 (quests / season / events). Same leaf format; the kind byte in the
//     leaf keeps proofs from being replayed across currencies.
//   * $CG stays the token for wagers, fusion fees and staking weight. SKR
//     wagers would need SKR escrow + rake with no burn — explicitly out of
//     scope (see docs/02 §7.7).
//
// Every constant below is mirrored in Rust and checked by scripts/sync-check.ts.

 * revenue, give-back ≈ 14 % at baseline, see `skrPoolMonthlyFunding`).

 *  - marketplace fee on SKR listings, treasury part only (⅔ of the 7.5 % fee;

 *    deflation lever): 10 %.
 *  - services paid in SKR: 5 % — cosmetics are the highest-margin line and were
 *    priced as pure revenue.
 * The pool share is a treasury policy, not a smart-contract rule: the treasury
 * wallet runs `fund_skr` weekly from the previous week's `sweep_vault` proceeds
 * (`npm run skr-pool -- plan …` prints the amount due). It is published here and
 * through `GET /rewards/skr-pool` (`funding.dueMicro` vs `fundedTotalMicro`) so
