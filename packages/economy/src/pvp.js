// GUTTERCAPS economy — PvP ("Cap Slam")
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Format: 3v3 squad, best-of-3 rounds, resolved instantly server-side with a
// verifiable seed. Not turn-based-interactive: the reference audience plays
// in 30-second sessions on mobile, and instant resolution lets us run
// thousands of matches per minute without websockets-per-turn. Players still
// make decisions BEFORE the match (squad, lane order, one "tactic" card),
// which is where skill lives.
//
// Fairness: the server derives round rolls from
//   seed = sha256(matchId ‖ nonceA ‖ nonceB ‖ serverSecret)
// where each player's client commits sha256(nonce) when queueing and reveals
// the nonce on match start (so nobody can change it after seeing the pairing),
// and the server cannot pre-compute a seed while pairing because it only knows
// the commits; serverSecret is published per season after the season ends so
// every historical match becomes re-verifiable (backend/src/arena.ts). Wagered matches
// additionally pin the seed to a Switchboard randomness account revealed
// on-chain (see programs/…/battle.rs) so the payout can't be influenced.
